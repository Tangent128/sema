TODO:

==== alpha?

fix autospawn- don't autoquit if PID 1

create api.proxy set of metatables
cmd() takes multiple args

usage help + README

==== beta?

don't killall script when main thread exits
script killall notifies connected clients w/ error

script loading / dofile
resolve resources (dofile, chdir, etc) to script location, gracefully handle bad paths
ensureFifo() / openRead() / openWrite()

prettyprint client output
limit server verbosity / consolidate error reporting (not perror + Lua error clutter)

check TODOs
evade DEBUG usage where possible
update Lua source version
test multiple copies of scripts (& different scripts) non-interfering
test packet concurrency (multiple packets in pipeline for sure, multiple reader threads if time?)
double check for error conditions/memory leaks/fd leaks

==== v0.9

env + "named" fds
"use"
wait for given time

==== v1.0

resolve file names relative to socket path? (more realpathness + common prefix?)
socket activation?
writes should block coroutines on full pipe
allow scripts to specify the socket they expect to run on (to ensure only one copy)
inotify?
metrics?
