TODO:

==== now

flesh out ./config to be a better sample,w/ useInstalledLua and such

don't killall script when main thread exits
script killall notifies connected clients w/ error, removes connections from can't-autoquit list

script [re]loading / dofile
resolve resources (dofile, chdir, etc) to script location, gracefully handle bad paths
ensureFifo() / openRead() / openWrite()

prettyprint client output
limit server verbosity / consolidate error reporting (not perror + Lua error clutter)

check TODOs
test multiple copies of scripts (& different scripts) non-interfering
test packet concurrency (multiple packets in pipeline for sure, multiple reader threads if time?)
test whether or not startDown is redundant
double check for error conditions/memory leaks/fd leaks

add version to --help

==== v0.9

env + "named" fds
"use"
wait for given time

add default "quit" (or maybe "shutdown"?) command

==== v1.0

resolve file names relative to socket path? (more realpathness + common prefix?)
socket activation?
writes should block coroutines on full pipe
allow scripts to specify the socket they expect to run on (to ensure only one copy)
inotify?
metrics?
